In the first segment of this task, we employed Splinter and BeautifulSoup to automate web browsing, gaining access to the Mars news website and retrieving HTML code. Our focus was on extracting titles and preview text from news articles, and we successfully saved this information.

Moving on to Part 2 of the assignment, we once again utilized Splinter and BeautifulSoup, this time to extract an HTML table, which we then converted into a Pandas DataFrame. Subsequently, we carried out diverse analyses and generated data visualizations to delve deeper into the Mars weather data.
